# Disk Drive Bot

This repository was created to demonstrate the capabilities of the 
[Telegram Django Bot Bridge library](https://github.com/alexanderaleskin/telegram_django_bot_bridge).

The code is provided under the CC0 License without any restrictions and obligations for use. 
[@Disk_Drive_Bot](https://t.me/Disk_Drive_Bot) is a running instance for demonstrating logic of the code.
You can test and see how it works, and you can also use it for its intended purpose ðŸ˜€

This repository provides an example of the implementation of storing documents in the cloud storage, where the storage
is Telegram. The bot gives the ability for creating files, folders, and sharing data with others.

The project has the following folders and items:

1. base -- the main directory with all the business logic of the bot;
2. bot_conf -- settings for launching Django and Telegram Django Bot bridge;
3. configs -- files for running docker containers;
4. locale -- translation for supporting localization (in this case Russian only, English used by definition);
5. run_bot.py -- this is the file that starts the bot;
6. common.yml, docker-compose.yml, docker-entrypoint.sh, Dockerfile -- files for running docker.

The easiest way to run your own bot is via docker-compose:

1. create and fill the .env file as specified in the .env.example;
2. start the containers by running the following command from the project directory: ```docker-compose up```.

Make sure docker and docker-compose are installed on your machine.
